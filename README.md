# PyAuditTracker
The project involves creating a microservice, named "AuditLogService," in Python. This service will receive and store various events from different systems, such as creating customer accounts or billing. It provides an HTTP endpoint for querying these events based on field values. Authentication is implemented for event submission and querying.
